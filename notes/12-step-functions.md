# Step functions
Allow you to visualize and test serverless applications. Step functions provide a graphical console to arrange and visualize application components as a series of steps. Step functions automatically trigger and track each step and retry when there are errors, to check if the application executes in order and as expected. Step functions log the state of each step, so you can diagnose what is going wrong.
